(Note: This is a special 48 hour project build)

Start Time: October 16, 2016 4:30pm
End Time:   October 17, 2016 TBD


##Arduino Code
  - [x] Link up the DHT22 sensor to the code and stream in data                                         (  October 16, 2016  5:13pm  )
  - [x] Link up the Adafruit Neo-pixels to the code and modify the pixels                               (  October 16, 2016  5:17pm  )
  - [x] Modularize both the sensor and neo_pixel code                                                   (  October 16, 2016  8:26pm  )
  - [x] Plan the UX on the device                                                                       (  October 16, 2016  10:26pm )
  - [x] Code the Main Loop to follow the UX pattern                                                     (  October 16, 2016  11:56pm )
  - [x] Comment code                                                                                    (  October 17, 2016  12:31am )

##PCB Design
  - [x] Spec out the relevant components                                                                
  - [ ] Calculate the power requirements on the circuit and validate battery consumption and life      
  - [x] Create and modularize the circuit schematic on Eagle
  - [x] Plan the Board Design for the PCB, and create a price estimate for the board
  - [ ] Create a price list for the PCB

##Hardware Modeling
  - [ ] Model PCB in the 3d program
  - [ ] Model individual components
  - [ ] Model Casing
  - [ ] Route extraneous wires in the casing
  - [ ] Update pricing sheet to the project
  - [ ] Run injection molding tests, and power dissapation tests (OPTIONAL)
