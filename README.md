# Comfort-Sensor

## Introduction

I've been having a bunch of headaches lately and I didn't know what the cause of those headaches was. Secondarily, during these migranes, I would notice that my mouth felt extreemly parched. Initially I had thought that the cause for these symptoms was that I wasn't drinking enough water. This, however, was not the case. I was drinking more than enough of my share of water and I was still feeling horrible. I needed to do something.

I finally arrived on the conclusion that the environment around me was partially causing these symptoms. I decided to build a sensor that told me the humidity and temperature readings in my environment; it would sort of be like a comfort indicator to determine whether these headaches were caused by my surroundings.

## Prototyping

### Planning the User Experience

User Experience is most important when designing a device like this one. What do we want the user to see? Based off of the limited number of components I had avaliable to me I opted for an analog approach in displaying the temperature and the humidity. It would sort of be like a clock. The User Experience is illustrated below.

`TODO: Add user-experience slides`

### List of Components

I began rummaging through my electronics and I managed to find a few components that I thought would be ideal to make such a device. They are listed below:

- Neo Pixel Ring
- Teensy 3.1
- Battery Management Unit
- Switch
- DHT22 Humidity and Temperature Sensor

`TODO: Place images of the components`

### Planing the wiring Diagram

Below is a figure of the wiring diagram I created. It is fairly simple.

`TODO: Upload a wiring diagram`

### Wiring up the Prototype

I ended up wiring the device up before I tested it, I had run out of breadboards, and generally this is a horrible idea; however, this was not my first rodeo. I felt confident that I knew what I was doing. Everything worked out without any hiccups.

### Writing the software

The code design is shown below in the diagram.

`TODO: Show the functional Diagram`

Translating the design to code was a fairly straight forward process. Keeping things simple in Embeeded systems design means that space on the microcontroller is preserved and that everything is running effeciently.
